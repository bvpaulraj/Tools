# Chapter II

So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the **Desert of Sahara**, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
_If you please--draw me a sheep!_

- What!
- Draw me a sheep!
